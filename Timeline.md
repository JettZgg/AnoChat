2.  **Project Structure**:
    
    -   Initialized the project structure for a FastAPI application.
    -   Included directories and files for `api`, `core`, `crud`, `models`, `schemas`, `services`, and `tests`.
3.  **Configured FastAPI Application**:
    
    -   Created initial FastAPI application files.
    -   Configured basic routing and dependencies.

#### Database Configuration

4.  **PostgreSQL Setup**:
    
    -   Ensured PostgreSQL server was running.
    -   Resolved initial connection issues.
    -   Created a user and database for the project.
5.  **SQLAlchemy Models**:
    
    -   Defined SQLAlchemy models for `User` and `TextMessage`.
    -   Configured SQLAlchemy settings in `database.py`.

#### Handling Configuration

6.  **Environment Variables**:
    -   Used `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables.
    -   Extracted sensitive information into a `.env` file.

#### Pydantic Models and Schemas

7.  **Pydantic Models**:
    -   Updated Pydantic models to use `from_attributes` instead of `orm_mode` to be compatible with Pydantic v2.

#### Testing

8.  **Test Setup**:
    
    -   Wrote unit tests for creating and reading text messages.
    -   Ensured proper setup and teardown of the test database.
9.  **Resolved Freezing Issue**:
    
    -   Added detailed debugging logs to identify where tests might be freezing.
    -   Ensured all async resources were properly awaited and closed.

#### Configuration for Testing

10.  **Pytest Configuration**:
    -   Updated `pytest.ini` to display warnings and run tests in verbose mode.
    -   Ensured the test path and Python path were correctly set in `pytest.ini`.

#### Final Testing and Cleanup

11.  **Run Tests**:
    -   Ran tests successfully, ensuring all resources were properly managed and closed to prevent hanging.

### Next Steps

1.  **Expand Test Coverage**:
    
    -   Add more tests to cover additional functionality and edge cases.
2.  **API Endpoints**:
    
    -   Implement additional API endpoints as needed.
    -   Ensure proper error handling and validation.
3.  **Frontend Development**:
    
    -   Begin developing the frontend to interact with the FastAPI backend.
    -   Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
4.  **Deployment Configuration**:
    
    -   Prepare deployment configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).
